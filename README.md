# Sales-Analysis


This project uses Python Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze 12 months' worth of sales data from an electronics store. The data includes hundreds of thousands of purchases, with information on product type, cost, purchase address, and more.

The project starts by cleaning the data, including dropping NaN values, removing rows based on a condition, and changing column types using methods like to_numeric, to_datetime, and astype. Once the data is cleaned, the project moves to the data exploration section, which answers five high-level business questions related to the data.

The five questions explored in this project are:

    1. What was the best month for sales, and how much was earned that month?
    2. Which city sold the most products?
    3.What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying products?
    4. Which products are most often sold together?
    5. What product sold the most, and why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions, the project uses various pandas and Matplotlib methods, including concatenating multiple CSVs to create a new DataFrame (using pd.concat), adding columns, parsing cells as strings to create new columns (using .str), using the .apply() method, using groupby to perform aggregate analysis, and plotting bar charts and line graphs to visualize the results. The project also labels the graphs to make them easier to understand."# Sales"
